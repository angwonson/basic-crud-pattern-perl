      # Use Filter to clean up the input data
      # Could use 'NonNumeric' below, but since Filters apply *before*
      # constraints, it would conflict with the 'Integer' constraint below.
      # So let's skip this and just use the constraint.

    # Add a select list for the user selection.  Note that we will
    # dynamically fill in all the users from the controller but we
    # could manually set items in the select by adding this YAML code:

      # One could argue we don't need to do filters or constraints for
      # a select list, but it's smart to do validation and sanity
